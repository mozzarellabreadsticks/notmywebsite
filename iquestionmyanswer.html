# iQuestion MyAnswer

- Rationality is strictly repeatable. But it must not be only repeatable or it would be nothing more than a record. 

- The antithesis of rationality is functionality. Functionality is not-strictly-repeatable because it has purpose and interacts externally.

Rationality interacts only with its own constituents.

---

Rationality and functionality are both conditions of the human mind. The distinction between is in the viewership.

Both rationality and functionality are externally concerned to a consciousness. The difference is in it's inclusion.

---

Human consciousness is a human phenomenon, but consciousness is metaphysical and the human being (*plus it's mind*) is matter.

To ask why a human being's human consciousness is limited by it's physical presence in matter is a stupid question.
