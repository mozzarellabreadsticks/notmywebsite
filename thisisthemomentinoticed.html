# This is the moment I noticed &#8635;

- As a writer I am producing recorded language for the reading audience which may come to view it afterwards. I write for them, and their hopeful wellbeing. It is important that my writing causes their wellbeing, because I am a writer and that is the function I serve. I would no longer be a writer if my writing does not cause them well-being. A writer serves a function, and it is a disfunction to cause harm. Only writers should write.

- I write. To be human is to use symbols. Symbols do not only serve for the purposes of communication. A symbol stands between what can be remembered and what can be experienced.
To record a symbol is to transfer the symbol from being remembered to being experienced. Placing symbols in your own immediate proximity is a powerful tool for exploring reality and its many contradicting facts.
