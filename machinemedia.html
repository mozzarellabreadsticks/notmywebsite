*It only has to work once but it must do so repeatably*

keyboard causes discreet events in time and
mouse causes continuous events in time

screen represents space in time as 2d

 
**what do computer be to me?**

I walk and then sit.
There be keyboard mouse and screen.
Keyboard and mouse be me and screen see as I do.

**but what do I see?**

sometimes I make me see stuff I do, others I see stuff I be screen


a computer is just its hardware, and computer software, as it's used graphically, as it always used, displays an illusion of stillness.

The modern evolution of holistic computer software is the desktop environment.

An interpretation software could be used to manipulate the pre-present desktop environment graphically via automation software. It could then generate it's own imiginal interface to replace the screen output at the display server level. As such, it would need to sit between two display servers, one to host the original desktop environment and one to host its own.
