# machine media

*It only has to work once but it must do so repeatably*

keyboard causes discreet events in time and
mouse causes continuous events in time

screen represents space in time as 2d

 
**what do computer be to me?**

I walk and then sit.
There be keyboard mouse and screen.
Keyboard and mouse be me and screen see as I do.

**but what do I see?**

sometimes I make me see stuff I do, others I see stuff I be screen


a computer is just its hardware, and computer software, as it's used graphically, as it's always used, displays an illusion of stillness.

The modern evolution of holistic computer software is the desktop environment.

An interpretation software could be used to manipulate the pre-present desktop environment graphically via automation software. It could then generate it's own imiginal interface to replace the screen output at the display server level. As such, it would need to sit between two display servers, one to host the original desktop environment and one to host its own.

## Implemented robustly

**The synthesis of interfacial computer software and hardware can be basically accomplished by duplicating the computer's computational hardware but not it's screen keyboard and mouse**

- ### Slave 1
  runs headlessly and receives the display server 
  output from the other computer. It modifies the
  received input frames as a literal pixel array
  representing the physical hardware monitor
  which it outputs to. This computer receives
  the direct input from the physical keyboard and
  mouse. It uses such data to construct an 
  interface through which it modifies the incoming
  input frames to accomplish software tasks in
  terms of the literal monitor image.

- ### Slave 2
  The second computer is not connected to the
  physical keyboard mouse and monitor. It is
  connected to the other computer with an ethernet
  cord and interacts through internet protocol. This
  computer two runs headlessly but unlike it's clone, running the same **latest-big-brand-linux-distribution-version** it *does* run the desktop environment in a virtual display server where it gets the frames for it's neighbor's use.

Slave 1 receives the frames from slave 2 and slave 2 receives virtual keyboard and mouse | movement and entry instructions from slave 1. So only is their technical interaction.

Two computers is nessicary to totally *effortlessly* eliminate the possibility of the machine media and graphical desktop software interacting as software.
